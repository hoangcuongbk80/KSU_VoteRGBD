This paper has received 4 reviews with overall negative comments. The
AE agrees with most of the reviewers that the details of the proposed
method and the references for comparisons are both missing. In addition
to the reviewers' comments, the AE thinks that the paper should conduct
a more thorough ablation study by replacing the proposed voting-based
fusion with other fusion alternatives to further validate the
effectiveness. Overall, the AE regretfully suggests Reject.
