The paper addresses the challenge of robust hand-object pose estimation
from RGBD data, a significant problem within computer vision, graphics,
and robotics. The method's relevance to robotics is evident, as precise
pose estimation can enhance robotic manipulation tasks. However, the
paper primarily focuses on the technical aspect of pose estimation
rather than presenting any concrete applications within robotics. This
focus makes the paper better suited for a vision conference rather than
a robotics-specific journal.

Technical Contribution:
The proposed method introduces a vote-based approach to improve pose
estimation performance, particularly by addressing the limitations of
two-branch architectures during fine-tuning. While the technique is
interesting and shows promise in enhancing prediction accuracy, it is
important to acknowledge that more recent works in the field have
reported higher prediction scores. The paper could benefit from citing
these works and positioning its contributions within this broader
context.

Related Work:
The paper would be strengthened by a more comprehensive discussion of
recent developments in hand-held object pose estimation. Specifically,
the authors should consider including and contrasting their work with
the following papers:

HOPE-Net: A Graph-Based Model for Hand-Object Pose Estimation (Dosti et
al., 2020)
Generalized Feedback Loop for Joint Hand-Object Pose Estimation
(Oberweger et al., 2020)

Writing & Presentation Comments:
The paper clearly articulates the problem scope and high-level
approach, making the research objective understandable. However, the
writing could be improved by distinguishing between the conceptual
framework and the implementation details. Currently, the dense methods
section makes it difficult for readers to follow the key elements of
the method vs the implementation details. All figures must be
referenced in the text. 
Consider refering to the visuals more frequently to aid the readers'
understanding.
